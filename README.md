### A rework of Minecraft's metalworking system

ReworkedMetals changes how furnaces work and how metals are smelted to give the player a better feeling of progression and accomplishment from unlocking new things.

Different tiers of furnaces allow for smelting different types of metals.
The same furnaces can also be used to create alloys.

The mod adds 2 new ores, 4 new metals, 7 new sets of tools and 5 new sets of armor.
